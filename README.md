# Homebrew micro

Micro is now an official Homebrew formula, so please use that instead:

```
brew install micro
```

or 

```
brew install --HEAD micro
```

---

This is the Homebrew tap for [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro).

```
brew tap zyedidia/micro
brew install micro
```

You can also install the master version of micro using `--HEAD`.

```
brew tap zyedidia/micro
brew install --HEAD micro
```
