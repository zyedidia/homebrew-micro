# Homebrew micro

This is the Homebrew formula for [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro).

```
brew tap zyedidia/micro
brew install micro
```

You can also install the nightly version of micro using `--devel`. Just make sure you remove cached versions brew has or there will be a problem with the checksum.

```
brew tap zyedidia/micro
brew install --devel micro
```
